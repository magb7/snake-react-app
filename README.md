## Snake React App

It's a personal project made during my training at the Wild Code School (Lille, France).

The game was based on those two tutorials made by [Chigabiga](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6R-ZK8bRI3jzWLUuw03Uw):
  - First video : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oOgsGP3t5o)
  - Second video : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgK7OTdT-eo)
  
## Time spent

  - The basics of the game were developed in one day (~ 7 hours).
  - The web site around the game : ~ 4 hours
